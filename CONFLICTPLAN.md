Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it if necessary.
Why:
Group projects can be stressful and emotions can run high. Put together a plan ahead of time so you all know how to deal with any potential issues later.
As a team, we are going to create a Group Agreement as a markdown file to document the following:
What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
Since there is 3 of us, we will mediate with voting
What is your process to resolve conflicts?
Hear all sides, individual deliberation, break with voting
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
If someone won’t follow along with the majority vote
Communication Plan
Before beginning to write code, determine how your group will communicate with each other.
Why:
This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone knows how the group will communicate with each other and that everyone feels comfortable speaking up.
Add your communication plan to your Group Agreement. Some things to consider:
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack if needed
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
Respect when other are speaking, make sure to include anyone who doesn’t seem comfortable speaking up
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Reminders to follow along with Flatiron’s code of conduct to control our group dynamics
